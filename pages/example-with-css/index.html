      <h2>Candy Man - Poem by Roald Dahl</h2>
      <p>
        Who can take a sunrise, sprinkle it with dew <br>
        Cover it in chocolate and a miracle or two <br>
        The candy man, the candy man can <br>
        The candy man can 'cause he mixes it with love <br>
        And makes the world taste good <br>
        <br>
        Who can take a rainbow, wrap it in a sigh <br>
        Soak it in the sun and make a strawberry-lemon pie <br>
        The candy man? <br>
        The candy man, the candy man can <br>
        The candy man can 'cause he mixes it with love <br>
        And makes the world taste good <br>
        <br>
        Willy Wonka makes everything he bakes <br>
        Satisfying and delicious <br>
        Talk about your childhood wishes <br>
        You can even eat the dishes <br>
        <br>
        Who can take tomorrow, dip it in a dream <br>
        Separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream <br>
        The candy man, Willy Wonka can, the candy man can <br>
        The candy man can 'cause he mixes it with love <br>
        And makes the world taste good <br>
        <br>
        And the world tastes good' <br>
        Cause the candy man thinks it should <br>
